## Inspiration
Food waste is a pressing problem in the United States. Up to 40% of our food supply goes to waste every year. We believe that it is imperative to do what we can to solve food waste by also solving for food insecurity.

## What it does
Round-A-Bout (named for the intersection, meant to evoke a renewed cycle) is an application that connects needy people with reliable sources of food. A recently enacted Austin municipal law requires restaurants and stores to either donate or compost excess food supplies - our goal is to leverage this legislation to boost the effectiveness of our application. 

Round-A-Bout also provides an effective way for businesses to track their food elimination trends on a weekly, quarterly, and yearly basis. This provides incentive for businesses to accurately track their excess food down to the barcode and quantity as they can only receive the best analytics this way.

## How we built it
This app is coded entirely in Java and was built using Android Studio.

## Challenges we ran into
I spent about 2 hours on a problem that took me 2 seconds to fix (I didn't define a width for a certain ImageView and crashed my emulator about 57 times trying to figure out why Android Studio hates me). I also did not understand anything about constraints or layouts and was surprised when I first tried running the emulator to see everything in the top left corner of the screen. I ran into so many challenges that at a certain point I didn't think I'd finish to demo, but look where we are now.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have a demo that accurately portrays the app experience and features a faithful implementation of the developed wireframes.

## What we learned
It was my first time working with mobile development at all and thus my first time working with Android Studio. I learned tons about Android development, including layouts, constraints, and how to work with the file structure among so much more.

## What's next for Round-A-Bout
Future applications include:
- Fleshed-out yearly analytics for the Business side
- Expanded roll-out in other cities
- Integrated barcode scanning
- Implementation of push notifications for stores user selects
